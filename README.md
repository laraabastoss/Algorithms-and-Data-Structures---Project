### Project 1 - LEICÂ´s Schedule Database Mannagement  (Grade: 16.9 /20) 

Developemnt of a software he software that allows students to include or remove Curricular Units, as well as request class transfers within a specific Curricular Unit. This functionality relies on CSV files that extract pertinent information from the Bachelor's program in Informatics and Computer Engineering database at FEUP. The implementation further integrates various Data Structures, including queues, stacks, and vectors, to optimize performance and enhance functionality.

### Project 2 - Airline Database Mannagement (Grade: 20.0 /20)

Developement of a software that makes use of CSV files comprising flight related data. Its primary objective is to facilitate the visualization of the most optimal route between two specified destinations, which can be airports, cities, or specific locations defined by latitude and longitude coordinates. Users can also search for multiple informations about the network such as top airports with the most flights. To achieve this, the software employs graphs implemented as an Adjacency List to store the relevant information. Additionally, it leverages various algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and a customized adaptation of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute and determine the shortest path efficiently.
