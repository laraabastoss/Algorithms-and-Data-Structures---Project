# Project 2 - Airline Database Mannagement (Grade: 20.0 /20)

Developement of a software development that makes use of CSV files comprising flight-related data. Its primary objective is to facilitate the visualization of the most optimal route between two specified destinations, which can be airports, cities, or specific locations defined by latitude and longitude coordinates. Users can also search for multiple informations about the network such as airports with the most flights. To achieve this, the software employs graphs implemented as an Adjacency List to store the relevant information. Additionally, it leverages various algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and a customized adaptation of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute and determine the shortest path efficiently.

**Technologies Used:** C++
